# Titanic-Kaggle-Submission
My Kaggle Submission on Titanic Survival Prediction

I just recently started “Kaggling” and I must say, the challenges can be quite addicting as you try and improve your predictions and see your name soar up the leaderboards as your prediction scores improve. I decided to take a shot at the Titanic challenge and was able to crack the top 38% with one of my submissions.

This is what it looked like when I submitted it:

This got me a score of 0.78468 which was good enough for top 38% at the time of submission.

I hope you can take from my submission and add your own ideas to try and get an even higher score!
